# Allergy/Contraindication Checker API Requirements Analysis

## Core Functionality

The Allergy/Contraindication Checker API will provide a service that checks if a given drug is contraindicated for a patient with specific allergies or medical conditions. The API will:

1. Accept a drug name/identifier and a list of patient allergies or conditions
2. Process this information against a database of known contraindications
3. Return warnings or alerts if the drug is contraindicated or requires caution
4. Provide severity levels and explanations for any identified issues

## MVP Scope

For the Minimum Viable Product (MVP), we will focus on:

1. **Common Drug Classes**:
   - Antibiotics (penicillins, cephalosporins, fluoroquinolones, macrolides, etc.)
   - Pain medications (NSAIDs, opioids)
   - Common OTC medications
   - Top 100 prescribed medications in the US

2. **Common Allergies**:
   - Drug allergies (penicillin, sulfa drugs, NSAIDs, etc.)
   - Common inactive ingredient allergies (sulfites, dyes, etc.)
   - Cross-reactivity groups (e.g., penicillin â†’ cephalosporin)

3. **Common Conditions**:
   - Pregnancy/breastfeeding
   - Renal impairment
   - Hepatic impairment
   - Cardiovascular conditions
   - Diabetes
   - Asthma

## Input/Output Format

### API Input:
```json
{
  "drug": {
    "name": "string",
    "rxcui": "string (optional)"
  },
  "patient": {
    "allergies": ["string"],
    "conditions": ["string"]
  }
}
```

### API Output:
```json
{
  "drug": {
    "name": "string",
    "ingredients": ["string"]
  },
  "contraindications": [
    {
      "type": "allergy|condition",
      "name": "string",
      "severity": "high|medium|low",
      "description": "string",
      "evidence": "string",
      "recommendation": "string"
    }
  ],
  "safe": boolean
}
```

## Target Users & Use Cases

1. **Pharmacists**:
   - Verify prescriptions against patient allergies
   - Provide alternative recommendations when contraindications exist
   - Document verification process for compliance

2. **Healthcare Applications**:
   - Integrate into e-prescribing systems
   - Add safety checks to patient portals
   - Enhance clinical decision support systems

3. **Patients**:
   - Self-check medications against known allergies
   - Verify OTC medication safety
   - Prepare questions for healthcare providers

4. **Clinical Researchers**:
   - Analyze patterns of contraindications
   - Support clinical trial participant screening

## Privacy & Compliance Requirements

1. **HIPAA Considerations**:
   - The API should process data without storing PHI
   - If any data is logged, it must be anonymized
   - API documentation must include guidance on HIPAA-compliant implementation

2. **Data Security**:
   - All API communications must use TLS/SSL encryption
   - API keys should be required for authentication
   - Rate limiting to prevent abuse

3. **Disclaimer Requirements**:
   - Clear statement that the API is a decision support tool, not a replacement for clinical judgment
   - Documentation of data sources and limitations
   - Recommendation to verify results with healthcare professionals

## Technical Requirements

1. **Performance**:
   - Response time under 500ms for standard queries
   - Ability to handle batch requests for multiple drugs/allergies
   - Scalability to handle varying load

2. **Reliability**:
   - 99.9% uptime target
   - Graceful degradation if certain data sources are unavailable
   - Comprehensive error handling

3. **Maintainability**:
   - Regular updates to drug database (monthly at minimum)
   - Versioned API to support backward compatibility
   - Comprehensive logging for troubleshooting

## Business Requirements

1. **Monetization Model**:
   - Tiered pricing based on request volume
   - Subscription options for healthcare organizations
   - Freemium model with limited requests for individual users

2. **Documentation**:
   - Comprehensive API documentation
   - Code examples in multiple languages
   - Integration guides for common healthcare systems

3. **Support**:
   - SLA options for enterprise customers
   - Documentation on data freshness and update frequency
   - Clear process for reporting potential errors in contraindication data
